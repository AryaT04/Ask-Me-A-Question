# Ask-Me-A-Question :interrobang:
#### A project that prompts the user to ask a question and answers the question using the openAI API.
### Technology Used:
For this program, I used Python and openAI API.
### Process:
First, I researched how to import the openAI API. Next, I created a personal key and hardcoded it into my program. Finally, I added promted the user for their input, sent the input to the API, and printed the response from the API. 

I had a lot of issues seetting up the pip install openai command on my mac because I had an error saying that pip command couldn't be found. I searched for a solution and most websites said that it was a problem with downloading Python sp I redownloaded it which caused even more issues since now I had two different versions of Python on my mac. I then deleted one of the versions but was still having issues so then I looked onstack overflow and it said that I likely had a problem with my bash and  would have to manually set up bash. Then, using the commands I found I was manually able to set up the 
bash and my pip command started working by my "import openai" line on VScode was still showing an error. Finally, I was able to fix the issue on the import openai line by just changing the interpreter. 
### Plans for Future Development:
I plan to add some error checking to make sure that the user only asks appropriate questions. However, I want to keep this code fairly simple so that I can implement it in more complex programs in the future.
